# WeatherApp

Application allows user to search cities and display weather information for selected city

## Description

This application was made to show my understanding of Combine framework and MVVM arhitecture while usin Coordinator pattern for navigation. 
When started user is asked if he would like to use his location for default city if not Vienna is set as default and current weather information is shown. 
By tapping on search bar new screen is modaly presented over current screen and user is able to type its querry. By selecting new city user is taken back to 
first screen which now shows current weather information for previosuly selected city. By tapping on settings user is taken to settings screen where all
previously selected cities are shown. User is able to delete stored city. Also user can select units in which results will be shown as well as conditions he/she 
would like to be shown.
